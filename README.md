- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nightshade22
- 👀 I’m interested in  program can send this http request, receive the html code, and then look through the code to figure out what the website is displaying, as well as figure out how to use buttons and links that might be on the page (in most cases buttons and links, such as a purchase button, are just another http request behind the scenes).

- advanced ones use HTTP post/get requests instead of using a headless browser to check product availability, add to cart and check out.

This is a so much quicker and in my experience, usually beats the anti bot system depending on the store. At least that's my experience with the bot I am writing.
headless browser, which means the bot can do everything you would do normally but you see no browser info. This helps with computer speed as it doesn't render the page.
